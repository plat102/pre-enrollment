**Assuming your 2 tables contain a huge amount of data and each join will take about 30 hours,
while you need to do daily report, what is your solution?**

---

1. Quickly review query execution plan
   * Spot issues & refactor code if possible
2. Pre-aggregated marterialied view/table
   * Run query during non-peak time (e.g. 0-5am) & save the result for daily report refresh in the morning
   * The report only read from the aggregated data
3. Apply incremental load & transform
   * Only process data that:
     * greater than  `<max run time of processed data>`
   * How:
     * SQL procedure to update report data table
4. Index
   * Consider apply index on the columns used in join & filter
   * Candidate
     * order.date_order
     * order.client_id
     * order_delivery.order_id
     * order_delivery.delivery_date
5. Partition table:
   * Purpose: reduce the data size scan
   * By: order year/moth
